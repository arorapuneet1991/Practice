Used to create complex objects where multiple attributes are skipped in some instances and
in some we need some other attributes

eliminiates heavy contrucotr calls
also eliminiates the modifications needed with evey new attribute being introduced

gives better contorl to the user to
we separate the object construction (done via constructor) and the class representation
(the state values of the variables of that particular object) in the builder pattern.

This is done by taking the control of value initialization from constructor inline code to the
builder
